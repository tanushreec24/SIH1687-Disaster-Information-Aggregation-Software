Organisation: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), MHA

Problem statement:
Disaster response agencies often stuggle to gather timely and specific information about emergencies from various sources. Social media platforms serve as a valuable repository of such data, but manually monitoring and sorting through the vast amount of information is inefficient and resource-intensive. Description: There is a pressing need for a software solution that can efficiently aggregate and categorize specific disaster-related data from social media, news portals, and other open sources. This software would utilize advanced algorithms to sift through the abundance of information and classify it into different categories data would then be presented on a user- friendly dashboard, allowing disaster response agencies to quickly access relevant information and plan their actions accordingly. Expected Solutions: The software solutions will streamline the process of gathering and categorizing disaster-related data from various soucres, significantly reducing the time required for response efforts. By providing real-time insights and actionable information, the software will enhance the effectiveness of disaster response operations, ultimately saving lives.
